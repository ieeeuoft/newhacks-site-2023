<p>Hello {{ user.first_name|striptags }},</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in {{ hackathon_name }}. We received an overwhelming number of applications this year - over 1200 in total. Due to the extremely competitive nature of the selections, we regret to inform you that we are not able to offer you a spot in the event this year.</p>

<p>While we appreciate your time, energy, and enthusiasm, we hope that this decision does not deter you from applying again next year. Each year, we aim to increase the number of attendees and to make our selection process as fair and inclusive as possible.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br>
The {{ hackathon_name }} Team</p>
